.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
handles both short sounds and music (\fIGUI Only\fP) 

\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
\fBAPI Stability: 2 - Unstable\fP\&. The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable\&. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Fire and Forget Playback"
.PP
This mode is typically used for short sound effects, like a footstep, an explosion, a single note of music, or some other momentary sound that doesn't need to be altered while playing\&. Use \fBplay()\fP for that sort of fire and forget sound\&.
.PP
\fBFire and Forget Example:\fP
.PP
.PP
.nf
PDG terminal v0\&.9\&.4
> pdg\&.run();  // must be running for sounds to play
> var snd = new pdg\&.Sound('test/clink1\&.mp3');
> snd\&.play();
> snd\&.play(0\&.3);
.fi
.PP
.PP
.SS "Dynamic Playback"
.PP
For longer sound effects and music, you will often want more dynamic control over the sound as it plays\&. The hum of a motor might change pitch and location as the sprite that generates it moves around on the screen\&. Background music may need to be paused or have it's volume changed independent of other sounds as it plays\&. Use \fBstart()\fP to play those sorts of sounds, then call other methods as needed to alter the sound playback\&.
.PP
\fBDynamic Playback Example:\fP
.PP
.PP
.nf
PDG terminal v0\&.9\&.4
> pdg\&.run();  // must be running for sounds to play
> var snd = new pdg\&.Sound('test/Peppy_The-Firing-Squad_YMXB\&.mp3');
> snd\&.start();
> snd\&.setVolume(0\&.3);
> snd\&.skip(2000);
> snd\&.setPitch(1\&.0);  // doesn't work on Windows
> snd\&.setPitch(0);
> snd\&.setOffsetX(1000); // full right 
> snd\&.setOffsetX(-500); // half left 
> snd\&.setOffsetX(0); // center
> snd\&.fadeOut(10000); // fade out over 10 seconds

.SS "changeOffsetX (inttargetOffset, intmsDuration, inteasing = \fC\fBlinearTween\fP\fP)"

.PP
change the left/right positioning of the sound's origin over time Adjust the apparent left/right positioning of the sound over a period of time to make the sound appear to be coming from a particular location in the view port\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
since different speaker setups and screen sizes can change the apparent location, this is a relative location only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
On Mac OS X this only works if the sound is in stereo, and the OS is version 10\&.7 (aka Lion) or later\&. It will fail silently on earlier versions or with mono or multichannel sounds; and the sound will play with center balance\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

\fItargetOffset\fP the target X offset from the center of the main view port 
.br
\fImsDuration\fP the amount of time to get there

.RS 4
a number from 0\&.0 to 1\&.0 representing the volume level for this sound\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This is not the absolute volume of the sound, since even at full volume (1\&.0) the sound's volume is scaled by the \fBSoundManager\fP's master volume

.SS "play (numbervol = \fC1\&.0\fP, intoffsetX = \fC0\fP, numberpitch = \fC0\fP, uintfromMs = \fC0\fP, intlenMs = \fCENTIRE_LENGTH\fP)"

.PP
play a sound once with given settings Can be called multiple times on same sound object, creating overlapping sounds\&. Internally, \fBplay()\fP creates a new sound instance that is automatically cleaned up when the sound has finished playing\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Once you've called \fBplay()\fP, the sound will play without interruption as specified\&. Calling \fBstop()\fP, \fBpause()\fP, \fBsetVolume()\fP, etc\&.\&. will have no effect; because they operate on the sound you actually have a reference to, not the internally created instance that is actually playing\&. Only \fBSoundManager\&.setVolume()\fP and \fBSoundManager\&.setMute()\fP will affect it\&. Use \fBstart()\fP if you need to affect the sound after it is playing\&.

.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

\fIvol\fP the volume level from 0\&.0 to 1\&.0, defaults to 1\&.0 
.br
\fIoffsetX\fP the left/right position offset from the center of the screen for the sound source\&. The pan/balance for the sound is adjusted accordingly\&. Negative numbers are from the left, positive to the right\&. Defaults to zero (no balance adjustment)\&. 
.br
\fIpitch\fP the amount to shift the pitch -1\&.0 is down one octave, +1\&.0 is up one octave\&. 
.br
\fIfromMs\fP start the sound from a particular ms time mark 
.br
\fIlenMs\fP the maximum number of ms to play the sound\&. If longer than the length of the sound this parameter is ignored\&. Defaults to playing the entire length of the sound\&.
