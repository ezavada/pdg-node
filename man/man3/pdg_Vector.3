.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
vector (magnitude and direction) within a 2D coordinate system\&. 

\fBPoint\fP provides support for dealing with vectors as x, y floating point values in 2 dimensional space\&. A vector is similar to an \fBOffset\fP but can be treated as a magnitude and direction where an \fBOffset\fP can't\&. The PDG coordinate space starts with the top left corner of the drawing port at Point(0,0) and the bottom left corner at Point( width, height );
