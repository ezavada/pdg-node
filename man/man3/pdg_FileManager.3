\fBAPI Stability: 2 - Unstable\fP\&. The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable\&. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable\&.
.RE
.PP
Most functions for file manipulation are provided by Node\&.js though the FileSystem class\&. The PDG \fBFileManager\fP just adds calls to get particular directory paths and to do file searchs\&.
